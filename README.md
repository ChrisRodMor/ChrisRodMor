Hey there! 👋
---

I'm Christian, an aspiring Ethical Hacker, Red Team enthusiast, and Pentester in training.

I enjoy learning how systems break, why they break, and how to make them stronger.

---

Right now I'm taking cybersecurity courses on Coursera and building personal labs on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box.

I mainly use Arch Linux as my daily driver and I'm slowly getting familiar with tools like Nmap, Burp Suite and Metasploit.

I'm especially interested in offensive security, web exploitation, and privilege escalation.

I document my learning journey and labs on GitHub to track my progress and share what I learn.

Fun facts:
- I use Arch btw 😄  
- I like learning through hands-on labs  
- I enjoy customizing my Linux environment
